## Upcoming Features

I'm currently working through a deep example project the really dogfood things and will be making updates around my finding from there. I also want to harden up the frontend work with NextJS soon as well and get that more widely available. If any React devs want to help with this definitely let me know!

Have a request for something you don't see below? Join [our discord](https://discord.gg/TBq2rVkSEj) and let's talk about it!
