Time is of the essence. Before developing a Pull Request I recommend opening a new [topic for discussion](https://github.com/pdevito3/craftsman/discussions). I also haven't had enough PR interest to take the time and put together a `contributing.md`, but if you are interested, I will definitely put together a detailed writeup.
