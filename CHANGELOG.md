# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
~~and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).~~

> Semantic versioning will come once I hit v1, but at this point each `0.x` release may have breaking changes as I iron out the kinks of the framework. 

## Unreleased

### Added

* Test Utility Mapper for Unit Tests
* New `User` and `UserRole` entities when using auth
  * Your auth server will still store users, but it's *only* role is now AuthN
  * Your auth server will still store users and their metadata that we want for AuthN and the new `User` entitiy will capture user metadata to be easily accessed in your app. Say you want to send back a list of recipes and show who created them, this gives you that info without having to reach out to your auth server
    * Eventual consistancy TBD
    * Redis cache TBD?

  * Roles will also not be dictated by your auth server anymore and will be stored in the context of your boundary (not the shared kernel anymore, though you could move them there if it makes sense for your setup). They are still restricted with a smart enum to `Super Admin` and `User`, but feel free to modify or extend these as you wish.
  * When starting your api for the first time, you will not have any `User` or `UserRole` entries. To add an initial root user, you just need to authenticate (e.g. swagger) and hit a protected endpoint. This is because, by default, the `UserPolicyHandler` will now check if you have any users and, if not, add the requesting user as a root user with `Super Admin` access.
    * You are welcome to change this logic if you wish, it is just an easy default to start with.

  * If you have multiple boundaries, you can make the call on how you manage things. By default each boundary will store it's own set of users and roles. This might be useful if say you want to manage users in your billing boundary separate from your inventory boundary, but you may want to combine them too. Feel free to consolidate this as you wish if desired.
  * Users can be managed at the `/users` endpoints. This includes adding and removing their roles as user roles have no standalone meaning without a user.
  * Updated functional tests to properly handle the token setup

* Unit of Work return a `Task<int>`
* Delete and Update commands return response based on UoW response
* Extra Ef Tools package for SqlServer

* `GetList` feature defaults to `-CreatedOn` sort order if none is given
* Better `DateOnly` serialization support
* `Newtonsoft` -> `System.Text.Json`
* `Update` feature calls update in repository

* Remove `.AddFluentValidation(cfg => {{ cfg.AutomaticValidationEnabled = false; }});` from registration as validation should be happening directly at domain level

* Integration and functional tests parallelized

* Integration tests updated to use `DotNet.Testcontainers` for simpler docker db setup
  
* Moved pagination, filter, and sort testing to unit tests

* `UserPolicyHandler` uses RolePermission repo and handles finding no roles

* Move most `UserPolicyHandler` tests to unit tests

* Move `CurrentUserServiceTests` test dir

* Simplified return on batch add feature

* CLI updates for auth server and bff scaffolds

* Migrated mapper to use `Mapster` instead of `Automapper` for easier value object usage and better performance. To migrate your project

  * Update your mappers to look like this (almost identicial to `Automapper`:

    ```csharp
    public class AuthorMappings : IRegister
    {
        public void Register(TypeAdapterConfig config)
        {
            config.NewConfig<AuthorDto, Author>()
                .TwoWays();
            config.NewConfig<AuthorForCreationDto, Author>()
                .TwoWays();
            config.NewConfig<AuthorForUpdateDto, Author>()
                .TwoWays();
        }
    }
    ```

  * Manaully do mapping in your entity factories (due to recurssive nature of the dtos and mapping happining in the factories)

  * Update usings to `using MapsterMapper;`

  * Your `ProjectTo` mappings should look like this:

    ```csharp
    var dtoCollection = appliedCollection
    		.ProjectToType<AuthorDto>();
    ```

    and import:

    ```
    using MapsterMapper;
    using Mapster;
    ```

  * Your registration should now be:

    ```csharp
    var config = TypeAdapterConfig.GlobalSettings;
    builder.Services.AddSingleton(config);
    builder.Services.AddScoped<IMapper, ServiceMapper>();
    ```

### Fixed

* Domain events captured and cleared in db context before running to prevent dups
* FKs use proper entity name for property (#90)

## [0.15.0] - 06/05/2022

### Added

* Open Telemetry and Jaeger tracing support

* `ValueObject` class scaffolding to `SharedKernel`
  
* Domain Event support for all `BaseEntities`. Automatically scaffolded for the `Create` and `Update` methods that call messages in a new `DomainEvents` directory under that entity. It works by adding messages to a new `DomainEvents` prop on each entity and publishing all messages on an EF save using MediatR. 

  * Unit tests are also scaffolded
  * To consume a message, you can use a MediatR `INotificationHandler` like normal. For example:
  
  ```c#
  namespace RecipeManagement.Domain.Authors.Features;
  
  using System.Reflection.Metadata;
  using DomainEvents;
  using MediatR;
  
  public class LogAuthor : INotificationHandler<AuthorAdded>
  {
      private readonly ILogger<LogAuthor> _logger;
  
      public LogAuthor(ILogger<LogAuthor> logger)
      {
          _logger = logger;
      }
  
      public async Task Handle(AuthorAdded notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
      {
          _logger.LogInformation("Author added: {AuthorName}", notification.Author.Name);
      }
  }
  ```
  
* Smart enum property support. Just add a property and give it a list of options using the `SmartNames` property and you're good to go. They will all be strings with smart enum backing. Attributes like filtering and sorting are supported

  ```yaml
  
    Entities:
    - Name: Recipe
      Features:
      #...
      Properties:
      - Name: Title
        Type: string
        CanFilter: true
        CanSort: true
      - Name: Visibility
        SmartNames:
        - Public
        - Friends Only
        - Private
        CanFilter: true
        CanSort: true
  ```

  


### Updated

* CLI commands no longer use `:` and use the more traditional space delimiter. For exmaple, `craftsman new example`

* Moved from old Startup model to new Program only for .NET 6. Includes updating test projects and service registrations for compatible setup

* All features will now use a repository instead of using dbcontext directly. 

* Batch does not require a dbset name anymore, but does require a plural entity name for the FK if using one. Functionally, this is the same as before just with a new name for the prop: `ParentEntityPlural`

* Entity props now `virtual` by default with a `protected` constructor for mocking in unit tests. This is mostly for foreign entities (since we don't have EF to populate our foreign entities in unit tests), but in order to have our mocks accurately reflect all our props, we need to make them virtual. For example:

  ```c#
  private static Author GetMockAuthor()
  {
    	// my fake data base generated with AutoBogus under the hood
      var fakeRecipe = FakeRecipe.Generate();
      var forCreation = new FakeAuthorForCreationDto().Generate();
      forCreation.RecipeId = fakeRecipe.Id;
      
    	// FakeItEasy making entity assignment easy in lieu of EF
      var fakeAuthor = A.Fake<Author>(x => x.Wrapping(Author.Create(forCreation)));
      A.CallTo(() => fakeAuthor.Recipe)
          .Returns(fakeRecipe);
      return fakeAuthor;
  }
  ```

  > **💡 DOCS NOTE: this is default, but depending on your domain ops, you might have a domain method that does the action for you, in which case, you won't want these to be virtual. For example, Recipe might have `SetAuthor` or `AddIngredient` methods and you wouldn't want those FKs to be virtual**

* Add `FakeItEasy` and `FakeItEasyAnalyzer` to unit test project

* Colocate DTOs with entities by default. Can be moved to shared kernel when needed

* Default db provider set to postgres

* Removed `?`'s on strings in  `BaseEntity` 

* Update integration test consumer registration to non-obsolete model

* Testing cleanup

* Performance optimizations for integration and functional tests

  * Integration tests will only wipe the db using checkpoint at the begining of the entire fixture run, not after each test. This affects how assersions can and should be made
  * Unit tests have parallelization

* Removed sort integration tests

* Messages get a class for better typing as well as an interface.
  
* Add postman client to example scaffolding

* Add support for offline access and client secret requirement settings for client credentials clients

* Automatically add a `SuperAdmin` role claim to machines

* Updated services to use Newtonsoft to keep support for patchdocs. `System.Text.Json` is still available if patchdocs aren't needed for a project.

* Integration Test `TestBase` has global autobogus settings

* Permission and role validations are not case sensitive

* Added `client_role` to `UserPolicyHandler` role check to accomodate machines with a new scaffolded test.

  * Machine example:

    ```c#
    new Client
    {
      ClientId = "recipe_management.postman",
      ClientName = "RecipeManagement Postman",
      ClientSecrets = { new Secret("secret".Sha256()) },
    
      AllowedGrantTypes = GrantTypes.ClientCredentials,
      AllowOfflineAccess = true,
      RequireClientSecret = true,
      Claims = new List<ClientClaim>() { new(JwtClaimTypes.Role, "SuperAdmin") },
    
      RedirectUris = { "https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback" },
      AllowedScopes = { "openid", "profile", "role", "recipe_management" }
    },
    ```

* A `docker-compose.yaml` will be added to your solution root by default for local development
  * Just run `docker-compose up --build` to spin up your databases (and RMQ if needed)

  * Then set an env and apply migrations. For a postgres example:
    * env

        *Powershell*
    
      ```powershell
      $Env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "anything"
      ```
    
        *Bash*
    
      ```bash
      export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=anything
      ```
    
    * `dotnet ef database update` or  `dotnet ef database update --connection "Host=localhost;Port=3125;Database=dev_recipemanagement;Username=postgres;Password=postgres"`
    
  * `SA` will always be default user for sqlserver so it can work properly

  * If no ports are given for api or db, they'll be auto assigned a free port on your machine

  * New `john` user to auth server (with no role)
  
  * Login hints for auth server
  
  * Minor helper override on fake generators
  
  * New `add:bff` command to add a bff to your solution

  * Basic unit test scaffolding for create and update methods
  
  * Unit tests for updating rolepermissions


### Updated

- Fixed bug in `Add` feature that had a chained action after `ProjectTo`. They will now be filtered like so:

  ```c#
  var {entityNameLowercase}List = await _db.{entity.Plural}
  	.AsNoTracking()
   	.FirstOrDefaultAsync({entity.Lambda} => {entity.Lambda}.{primaryKeyPropName} == {entityNameLowercase}.{primaryKeyPropName}, cancellationToken);
  
  return _mapper.Map<{readDto}>({entityNameLowercase}List);
  ```

- Removed `ProjectTo` from `GetRecord` feature in favor of direct mapper.

- Initial commit will use system git user and email as author. Courtesy of @sshquack

- `Id` on `BaseEntity` is sortable and filterable by default

- Minor logging updates for better json formatting and more information in prod

- GET record, PUT, and DELETE all have typed ids (e.g. `{id:guid}`) on their controllers

- `Development` environment uses a connection string to an actual database now, instead of an in memory db. This can easily be spun up with a `docker-compose` for local development

- Environment is now a singular object that will take in values for local environment variables for development and placed in launch settings and your docker compose. When deploying to other environments, you will use these same environment variables, but pass the appropriate value for that env.

  - Updated auth properties to be under an `AuthSettings` object like we do for broker settings
  - Removed `ConnectionString` from env. Docker connection will be added automatically in launch settings
  - Removed `EnvironmentName` as it will always be `Development`
  - Updated examples to handle new environment setup

- Removed unused mapper from delete feature

- Updated entity property definition with optional `ColumnType` attribute

- Fixed a bug that broke registration of the bus in development env

- Logger modifications

- Cleanup batch add feature

- Updated `Created` response for batch add

- Use entity plural directory for tests

- MassTransit bumped to v8

- Bumped Nuget packages to latest

- Updated checkpoint in test fixture for major version bump

### Removed

- Removed seeders

### Fixed

- Dbcontext for userpolicyhandler uses template (#70)
- Patch cancellation token added in feature
- Typo in role permission validation

## [0.13.1] - 02/25/2022

### Fixed

* `add:entity` command will now use the correct solution folder


## [0.13.0] - 01/27/2022

### Added

* Entities will now have private setters, a static `Create` method and an `Update` method to promote a DDD workflow
  * This includes base entity and the dbcontext setters for the auditable fields
* A huge permissions overhaul
  * `SuperAdmin` role is added by default and will automatically be given all permissions. 
  * A `User` role with also be created. This role will not have any permissions assigned to it by default and can be removed if you would like **as long as you add another role in addition to `SuperAdmin`**. This will allow for integration tests of the `UserPolicyHandler` to be fully scoped.
  * A permission will be added for each feature with a default name of `CanFEATURENAME`, but can be overridden if desired.
  * Role-permission mappings outside of this need tobe done manually 
  * You will be responsible for managing permissions outside of super admin
  * Policies are no longer part of the craftsman api, but a single policy will be added with each api boundary to swagger to dictate access to that boundary. It has a default of a snake case of `ProjectName`, but can be overridden
    * If using the built in auth server, this will be added for you. if not, make sure it mataches an appropriate scope in your auth server for this api boundary
  * Features now have a prop for `IsProtected` that, if true, will add an authorization attribute to your endpoint with the `PolicyName` and add tests that check for access
  * Integration tests for `UserPolicyHandler`
  * Unit tests for `RolePermission`
  * `Policies` prop removed from Feature
  * Added `SetUserRole` and `SetUserRoles` methods to integreation tests' `TestFixture` for easy role management in integration tests
  * Functional tests auth helper method now sets `role` instead of `scope`
  * Alice is a `SuperAdmin` and bob is a `User`
* Added a `register:producer` command with CLI prompt
* Added `UseSoftDelete` property to the `ApiTemplate` which is set to true. When adding an entity after the fact, Craftsman will automatically detect whether or not your project is using soft deletion by checking base entity for the appropriate property.
* Added a `SharedKernel` project at the root to capture DTOs, exceptions, and roles (if using auth)
* Added new `Complex` example for `new:example`


### Updated

* Updated FK and basic examples to have more features on the entities

* Updated tests to work with new private entity workflow

* CurrentUserServer has a method to get the User from the ClaimsPrincipal

* Swagger question removed from `add:feature` as it wasn't being used. Will be set to true.

* Removed unused `Unauthorized` and `Forbidden` MediatR filters 

* Test Fixture updated to better handle MassTransit

  * `_provider` will always be injected, even when not using MassTransit

  * The end of the fixture has been slightly updated to look like this:

    ```c#
            // MassTransit Harness Setup -- Do Not Delete Comment
    
            _provider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
            _scopeFactory = _provider.GetService<IServiceScopeFactory>();
    
            // MassTransit Start Setup -- Do Not Delete Comment
    ```

  * Added several helper methods to the test fixture

  * Updated the consumer test to use the helper methods

  * Producer doesn't take in placeholder props

  * Producer test generated

* Minor update to naming of producer in the bus example

* Default exchange type now `Fanout` for producer and consumer

* Added optional (but recommended) `DomainDirectory` prop to producers and consumers. This will move them from the `EventHandlers` directory and keep them directly with features for better colocation.

* Updated the 1:1 relationships to use proper scaffolding.

* Updated the FK example to show proper 1:1 relationship

* Entities with a Guid prop will no longer have a default of `Guid.NewGuid()`

* Updated default library from NewtonSoft.Json to System.text.Json (https://github.com/pdevito3/craftsman/issues/52)

* Took audit fields off of DTO

* Bumped LibGit2Sharp to preview for M1 compatibility

### Fixed

## [0.11.2] - TBD

### Fixed

- Better variable name on delete integ test

## [0.11.1] - 2021-08-23

### Fixed

- Added a new `features` option to entities to allow for granular feature control. The accepted values are `AdHoc`, `GetRecord`, `GetList`, `DeleteRecord`, `UpdateRecord`, `PatchRecord`, `AddRecord`, and `CreateRecord` (same as `AddRecord` but available as an alias in case you can't remember!)

### Changed

- Instead of 3 BC projects (Core, Infra, Api) there will now be one. This helps with colocation and does force premature optimization for something like a model library and a heavily separated infra project.

- A conflict integration test will not be added anymore
- `NoKeyGenerated` commands are no longer in dbcontext
- Controller url all lowercase
- Swagger comments on by default
- 409 no longer shown on swagegr comments for POST
- No more save successful check on delete command
- Seeders have a sub `DummyData` directory
- Sieve service registration moved to webapi service class

- Added Messages to the domain template
- Added `add:message` command
- Added conflict test for add command when using a guid
- Added tests for command and query exceptions
  - Didn't do them in the controller as that is not the dependency. Can test the exceptions causing the correct httpstatus code in the exception separately

- Updated the default Cors policy name
- Consolidated launchsettings to have the same setup for all environments as it is just a setting for the IDE and not used for the release package

### Removed

  - Gateways were removed and may be added back with better integration in a future release
- Removed the `new:api` command to focus on the DDD driven style
- Removed `ClientSecret` to promote code+PKCE flow

### Fixed

### Clean up

- Internal tests now passing
- refactored out template drilling
- removed old auth debt from earlier alpha

## [0.7.0] - 2021-01-12

### Added

- Removed the dependency on the foundation api template!

### Fixed

- Fixed `UseEnvironment` in WebAppFactory to use `Development`
- Fixed integration tests to use the new `Response` wrapper
- Updated pagination tests to have proper keys due to default sort order possibly breaking these tests

## [0.6.1] - 2021-01-06

### Fixed

- XML comment info is now properly added to `WebApi.csproj` and the Swagger config
- Extra line will no longer be added when no swagger contact url is provided

## [0.6.0] - 2020-12-22

### Added

- Added table name and schema properties to entity
- Added column name attribute to entity properties
- Added Serilog by default in all new projects. This includes Console and Seq logging by default in `Development`. For non-Development environments, you'll need to add whatever logging you're interested in to their respective app-settings projects. There are just too many options to create a whole API on top of Serilog.
- Updated swagger implementation from nswag
- Added Consumes and Produces headers to the controller endpoints

- Added an option to manage additional swagger settings to your API endpoints. This will be turned off by default for now as dealing the with xml docs path is potentially burdensome, but will add a lot of valuable details for users consuming your API. If you are looking to add additional XML details, this is highly recommended. 
- Added a custom Response Wrapper to the GET and POST endpoints

### Fixed

- Fixed launch settings to have null environment  variable for Startup (Production). If you'd like to change this, be sure to update the appsetting lookup in `Program.cs`
- Fixed POST endpoint that was lacking a `[FromBody]` marker
- `BasePaginationParameters` will now have `MaxPageSizee` and `DefaultPageSize` set as `internal` properties so they don't show up in swagger. These can be overridden in the distinct entity classes like so: `internal override int MaxPageSize { get; } = 30;`
- Fixed controllers to be able to handle a name and plural with the same value (e.g. Buffalo)

## [0.5.0] - 2020-12-14

### Fixed

- Fixed `craftsman add:property -h` to point to the correct help page

## [0.3.0] - 2020-11-14

### Added

- Updated the API to run on NET 5.0
- Pagination metadata enhancements on PagedList that is returned in  GET list endpoint will now include more metadata for the current page  including the current size as well as the start and end indices. I also  removed the Next and Previous Page URI links to reduce complexity.
- Updated all controller calls to be asynchronous, including the get list
- Saves updated to be asynchronous
- One major capability I want to add into this is a good basis for auth  generation. I've started to build this out, but it could (and very  likely will) change drastically. With that said, I left it in as an  alpha feature in case anyone is interested in trying it.

### Fixed

- Add Entity bug in repository fixed
- Fixed some builder options when not using auth
